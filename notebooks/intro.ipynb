The Kenya Health Policy 2014-2030 outlines the direcƟon that \\nthe sector is taking to ensure signŝĮcant improvements are made in the \\noverall status of health in Kenya in line with the ConsƟtuƟon of Kenya \\n2010, the country’s long-term development agenda, Vision 2030 and \\nglobal commitments such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). \\nKenya has made signŝĮcant progress towards the achievement of \\nUniversal Health Coverage (UHC) by ensuring that delivery of health care services at all levels of the health \\nsystem, is equitably distributed and adequately supported with access to quality products. \\nIn line with Kenya’s Vision 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals, The Government of Kenya \\nthrough the BoƩom-Up Economic TransformaƟon Agenda (BETA) has commiƩed to providing Universal \\nHealth Coverage (UHC) as part of socio-economic transformaƟon by providing equitable, aīordable and \\nquality health care of the highest standard to all Kenyans. \\nAs the country draws the roadmap towards acceleraƟng implementaƟon of the BETA Health Agenda, \\ndetermining the level of service availability and readiness across the sector is paramount. The Įndings \\nfrom this Health Facility Census 2023, will be instrumental in informing planning, guiding investments and \\nconsequent management of available resources to maximize on outputs, both at the NaƟonal and County \\nlevel. \\nWe look forward to working collaboraƟvely across the naƟonal and county governments, partners, and all \\nother stakeholders to ensure successful implementaƟon of the Įndings as we work towards our vision of a \\nhealthy, producƟve and globally compeƟƟve naƟon. \\n  \\n \\nNakhumicha S.

The Ministry of \\nHealth remains commiƩed to supporƟng \\nprovision of equitable, aﬀordable and \\nquality health services at the highest \\naƩainable standards to all Kenyans. In \\naddiƟon, The Government proposes a paradigm shiŌ in investments from the largely curaƟve approach to \\nfocus on prevenƟve and promoƟve health care. \\nThe Country has made considerable progress in managing its health system, driven in part, by \\nstrengthened mechanisms to support data collecƟon and use across the healthcare ecosystem. The \\nFacility Census 2023 aimed at providing baseline informaƟon on service availability, readiness of health \\nfaciliƟes to deliver services, availability of human resources and health infrastructure across all health \\nfaciliƟes and in turn provide a framework to inform investments to address criƟcal gaps in health service \\navailability and readiness. \\nIt is my hope and wish that stakeholders in the health sector will ﬁnd value in adopƟng the ﬁndings and \\nrecommendaƟons captured herein to strengthen Kenya’s health system to realize full potenƟal and \\nquality service delivery. Evidence esƟmates that by integraƟng the generated results into the strategic \\ndevelopment agenda, Kenya will monitor, and scale up its intervenƟons in pursuit of Universal Health \\nCoverage (UHC) and on course to realizaƟon of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nMs. Mary Muthoni H.S.C. \\nPrincipal Secretary,  \\nState Department for Public Health and Professional \\nStandards \\n \\n \\n \\nMr. Harry Kimutai, C.B.S.  \\nPrincipal Secretary    \\nState Department for Medical Services \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",

Public, private, faith-based/non-governmental \\norganizations health facilities accounted for 47%, 46% and 8% of the assessed health facilities respectively. \\nAll Level 6 facilities were government owned while most of Level 4 (49%) and Level 5 (44%) were privately \\nowned. \\nA total of 2,633 facilities did not appear in the Kenya Master Facility List, most of them being new; 12 \\nfacilities were duplicated in the KMFL (some of these are facilities had moved to new locations and had \\ngotten new KMFL codes) and many facilities claimed they were misclassified in the KMFL. A number of \\nfacilities had mismatched names or were misplaced between Counties. To arrest these issues, the Kenya \\nmaster facility list needs to be updated. \\nOverall, only 40% of all facilities were accredited by NHIF. Across levels of care, NHIF accreditation was \\nhighest in government level 2 facilities (57%). NHIF accreditation varied across the counties with only 10 \\nCounties having more than half of their facilities accredited, while 12 counties had less than 25% of their \\nhealth facilities accredited. There’s an urgent need to accredit health facilities with NHIF, especially \\nprimary facilities. \\nOver eighty percent of the facilities had a reliable power and water source; 87% reported national grid as \\ntheir main source of power while 45% of facilities used piped/municipal council water supply. Half of the \\nfacilities (51%) lacked access to functional ambulances. Furthermore, 84% of facilities were accessible by \\nroad all year round. More than two thirds of facilities (69%) did not use any electronic healthcare \\ninformation system (EHIS) with 62% among those who had an EHIS using integrated/end-to-end systems. \\nInvestments should be made to iincrease facilities connected to piped water from 45% and ensure all \\nweather access to all facilities. Further, all facilities should have power back-up systems in place. \\nOverall, forty-seven percent of facilities had disability friendly infrastructure however only 4% of the \\nfacilities had all the tracer disability friendly infrastructure including; - Ramps/lifts, wheelchair, disability \\nfriendly washrooms and disability friendly maternity beds. Ramps/lifts were the most reported (82%) \\nwhile disability friendly maternity beds were least readily available at 7%.  \\nProvision of disability friendly infrastructure in health care facilities should be prioritized in all facilities. \\nOverall, 90% (11,147 of the 12,384) of all facilities provided at least one of the 16 basic outpatient \\nservices. Notably, only 2% of these health facilities offered all the 16 services. Availability of basic \\noutpatient services was varied as outlined; Referral mechanism (100%); Management of communicable \\ndiseases (84%); Maternal child health services (83%); Management of non-communicable diseases (81%); \\nMinor surgical services (73%); Immunization services (69%); Basic laboratory services (68%); Outreach \\nservices (64%); General emergency services (60%); Emergency obstetric services (60%); Maternity services \\n(47%); Emergency obstetric care (33%); Obstetric and gynecological services (31%); Mental health services \\n(17%); Dental services – extraction (12%); Physiotherapy (10%); and Rehabilitative services (6%). The \\nreadiness to offer basic outpatient services (defined as having all the necessary personnel, equipment and \\ninfrastructure requirements to offer a specific health service) was at 7%. Nearly all (97%) of the health \\nfacilities had the required personnel (at least a nurse, clinical or medical officer) to provide basic \\noutpatient services. The main gaps were in the required infrastructure and equipment which were \\navailable in 77% and 15% of these health facilities respectively. \\n',\n",

Availability of basic equipment is especially a critical gap that needs to be \\nbridged for quick gains. \\nMajority of health facilities that provided specialized outpatient services offered obstetrics/gynaecology \\n(69%), paediatrics (61%), general surgery (57%) and internal medicine (57%). A minority of these facilities \\noffered renal services (21%), cardiology (18%), neurology (15%), endocrinology (11%) rheumatology (11%) \\nand cardiothoracic/vascular surgery (7%). \\nLess than half of the facilities in the country were offering maternity services with only a third of the \\nfacilities offering emergency obstetric care. Despite a majority of the facilities having adequate delivery \\nbeds and delivery packs, critical gaps were noted such as; only 40% of the facilities offered blood \\ntransfusion services while only 54% of the facilities had a source of oxygen.  \\nAccess to newborn health services in the country was low at 12%. Overall availability of equipment within \\nfacilities offering newborn services was good however only about half of the facilities offering newborn \\ncare had CPAP machines. \\nInvestments are critically needed in equipment, supplies and human resource to deliver both basic and \\ncomprehensive maternity services and for newborn care (vacuum extractors, resustiares, Oxygen source, \\nCPAP among others). This impacts negatively on maternal and newborn health outcomes and is a barrier \\nto improving quality of care during and after delivery.  \\nOne in every five facilities assessed were offering in-patient services, the majority of which were medical \\nand pediatric inpatient services at 85% and 69% respectively. Less than a third (27%) offered inpatient \\nsurgical services. Only 4% of facilities were offering inpatient services for oncology and psychiatric \\nservices. \\nA total of 381 facilities offered critical care services; 217 (1.8%) facilities provided High Dependency \\nservices (HDU) and 164 facilities provided Intensive Care services (ICU). Nationally, there are a total of 899 \\nICU adult beds, 196 ICU pediatric beds and 258 ICU neonatal beds. A total of 951 HDU adult beds and 275 \\nHDU cots were reported. CPAP machines were the least unavailable critical care item while most services \\nare provided by private facilities. \\n Investments in Critical care services should be scaled up especially in public facilities in consideration of \\nthe proposed chronic diseases fund, so that once established, patients can access quality critical care \\nservices within acceptable cost (Public Facilities). \\nSlightly over half of facilities were providing pharmacy services (57%) and of these, only a small \\nproportion had the full basket of tracer medicines (6%) and tracer non-pharmaceutical supplies (15%). \\nAverage availability for tracer drugs and non-pharmaceuticals was 62% and 73% respectively.  In terms of \\nnon-pharmaceuticals, solusets for fluids, sunction catheters and nasal prongs for oxygen delivery were not \\nwidely available in health facilities; only 40% of all facilities and 25% of the level 2 facilities had these \\nitems.  \\nInvestments need to be scaled up (at KEMSA) to ensure 100% availability of all tracer drugs and non-\\npharmaceutical supplies in all health facilities. This would prevent the inconvenience experienced when \\npatients have to buy drugs and non-pharmaceuticals especially while admitted. \\n',\n",

Most basic \\nlaboratory tests (Stool for ova and cyst, HIV/AIDs, Blood glucose, Dipstick for urinalysis, Malaria, Urine test \\nfor pregnancy (PDT) were readily available while Sputum test for TB and full haemogram tests were \\navailable in less than half of the facilities. Notably, primary level facilities with a laboratory had most basic \\nlab tests. The least available laboratory services were culture and sensitivity (14%), Lipid profile (28%), and \\nBiochemistry (32%). Most facilities with laboratory services had the personnel needed while a third lacked \\nthe necessary infrastructure. Capacities to provide TB diagnosis services and full haemogram should be \\nstrengthened at PHC facilities. The scope of Xpert machines should be expanded to offer TB diagnostic \\nservices within regions/Counties. In secondary and tertiary facilities, necessary capacities to provide lipid \\nprofiles, Culture and sensitivity as well as molecular testing should be put in place. \\nRadiology services; Overall, availability of radiology services was 11%; Ultrasound and x-ray services were \\nthe most available with radiology services at 95% and 62% respectively. Specialized radiology services like \\nPET and radionuclide scans were available in less than 5% of the facilities. Readiness to provide the basic, \\ncomprehensive and specialized radiology services was low at 21%, 1% and 5% respectively. To ensure \\nquality PHC services, overall access to radiology services should be enhanced; particularly to increase \\navailability of basic radiology services and enhance the readiness to provide the services.  Further, there is \\nneed to reconsider policy direction in use of mammograms for screening of breast cancer; MRI services \\nshould be availed within geographical regions to ease access to the service, ensuring the MRI facilities are \\naccredited with NHIF. \\nRenal services were available in only 2% of facilities. In addition, less than half (42%) of facilities providing \\nrenal services had all the necessary equipment, services and infrastructure. In view of the rising burden of \\nNCDs in the country, kidney transplant and post-transplant services should be enhanced to reduce the \\nburden of population needing dialysis, and improve quality of life for patients with renal failure. \\nAvailability of emergency services in the country are at a precarious state as indicated by the census. For \\ninstance, only 5.8% of all facilities had accident and emergency unit while 49% facilities had access to an \\nambulance. A third of those with access to an ambulance could only access a BLS Ambulance. That said, all \\nfacilities reported to have referral services. Arrangements should be made for all facilities to access an \\nambulance, even on contract basis to facilitate an efficient referral process. Higher level facilities should \\nbe resourced to acquire at least an advanced life support ambulance (ALS) to enhance patient \\nmanagement. \\nFor specialized services, fewer lower-level facilities were found to offer ophthalmology(eye), ear, nose \\nand throat, rehabilitative and mortuary services compared to higher level facilities. There is need to \\nImprove on the availability and access to specialized and sub specialized medical services in the secondary \\nand tertiary hospitals. This will also market Kenya as a preferred destination for inbound medical tourism \\nIn regards to health workforce, it was noted that access to health workers such as nurses and clinical \\nofficers was greater than other cadres such as pharmacists and dentists. In addition, health workforce was \\ninadequate and below the WHO recommended norms per population. This could have a negative effect \\non access to quality health care and more so for understaffed cadres such as dental and pharmaceutical \\nstaff, and hamper the formation of multidisciplinary teams for holistic care. For efficient use of existing \\nworkforce, capacities of existing staff should be enhanced to leverage on their availability to provide \\nbetter quality care. This includes also enhancing staff welfare including better enumeration and work \\n',\n",

It provides that every person has a right to the highest \\nattainable standard of health, which includes reproductive health and medical emergency care. The \\nstrategic direction for the health sector in Kenya has been defined through the Kenya Health Policy (KHP) \\n2014-2030 and the Kenya Health Sector Strategic Plan (2018-2023), in line with the Kenya Vision 2030 and \\nthe Bottom-up Economic Transformative Agenda (BETA).  A Health Systems Thinking Approach has been \\nintroduced to guide health sector investments and intervention to maximize on the overall sectoral \\ninputs; presenting a paradigm shift from managing disease and illness to an emphasis on ensuring a \\nhealthy population. \\nThe Ministry of Health is committed to supporting provision of equitable, affordable and quality health \\nservices at the highest attainable standard to all Kenyans. This will ensure access to quality and affordable \\nhealth services in line with the Constitution and thus accelerate the attainment of Universal Health \\nCoverage (UHC). \\n1.2 HEALTH STATUS \\nKenya faces a triple burden of disease where communicable diseases still dominate all causes of morbidity \\nand mortality with infectious diseases and injuries contributing more than half of the deaths but with an \\nestimated 39% due to non-communicable diseases.  It is projected that in the coming years the share of \\ndeaths from noncommunicable diseases and injuries will continue to increase [1]. \\n1.3 OVERVIEW OF KENYA’S HEALTH SYSTEM \\nThe Constitution of Kenya 2010 established a two-tier health system; the national and county. The \\nNational level deals with health policy, national referral hospitals, capacity building and technical \\nassistance to the Counties. The County Departments of Health are responsible for managing county health \\nfacilities and pharmacies, managing ambulance services, promoting primary health care, licensing and \\ncontrol of undertakings that sell food to the public, veterinary services (excluding regulation of the \\nprofession), cemeteries, funeral parlours and crematoria, refuse removal, refuse dumps and solid waste \\ndisposal, and health workforce recruitment and deployment. \\n1.4 UHC ASPIRATION \\nThe Government of Kenya is committed to implementing Universal Health Coverage (UHC) as part of the \\ngovernment economic transformation plan. This will ensure that all individuals and communities in Kenya \\nhave access to quality essential health services without suffering from financial hardship. \\nThe Government through the Ministry of Health has prioritized provision of primary health care including \\na focus on Community Health Promoters within the community level. This is in order to shift the focus of \\nhealth sector investment to preventive and promotive health care. It is thus intended to strengthen the \\n',\n",

The \\ncensus aimed to capture all the 14,366 public, faith-based organizations and private health facilities from \\nacross the 47 counties in Kenya whose details were available on the Kenya Master Health Facility List (as \\nper 1st August, 2023).  \\n \\nThe census teams were organized through a national coordination team (10 coordinators each covering 3-\\n6 Counties) and County level data collection teams. Each County team (managed by one supervisor) was \\nfurther divided into sub-County teams that carried out the enumeration tasks and the administration of \\nthe census questionnaires. Each sub-County team was assigned a defined number of health facilities \\n(taking into consideration the level of care of the health facilities to manage team workloads). In total, 564 \\nenumerators collected the data. In addition, the census teams worked with the county officials to identify \\nand enumerate any additional health facilities that were not in the Kenya Master Facility List (KMHFL). \\n2.2 HEALTH FACILITY DATA COLLECTION \\nA health facility census and assessment questionnaire were developed focusing on the following main \\nareas: \\n1) Facility identifiers - including the name of the health facility, KMFL code, Kenya Essential Package \\nfor Health (KEPH) level, geocodes, and administrative location (ward, sub-County, County); \\nownership; NHIF registration/accreditation status \\n2) Facility basic amenities/enablers - including electronic health information system, water sources, \\npower supply and backup facilities, sanitary, transport systems and ambulance, staff housing and \\ncall rooms, security mechanism \\n3) Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) \\n4) Available Human Resource for Health including number and cadre of staff \\n5) Primary Health Care services including facility link to community health units, and basic outpatient \\nservices offered \\n6) Specialized Health Services provided \\n7) Availability of equipment required to provide the health services \\n8) Availability of infrastructure needed to provide the health services \\n \\nThe questionnaire was digitized using the KoBocollect software and pre-loaded onto tablets to allow for \\nelectronic data collection. A total of 14,366 health facilities in the Kenya Master Facility List were loaded \\nand formed the census target across the country. All the data collection teams were trained on these tools \\nbefore the start of the census. For efficiency of data collection, the tool was split into three sections; \\nAdministrative, Clinical and Specialized sections. This allowed for up to three data collectors to \\nconcurrently administer the tool at each health facility. At each health facility, the questionnaires were \\nadministered to facility administrators or their representatives. The data were transmitted electronically \\nto a central server for storage and analysis. \\n',\n",

The number of health facilities that had complete \\ndata was determined and formed the basis of the subsequent analysis. Descriptive analysis of the \\nvariables related to each of the eight focus areas listed in the section above were conducted. These results \\nwere presented in tables and graphs. \\n \\nAnalysis of availability of health services was calculated as the proportion of the total health facilities \\nsurveyed that reported offering specific health services (e.g., outpatient visits, immunization services, \\ncomprehensive maternal services, renal services etc.) at National, County and sub-County level. \\n \\nTo determine readiness to offer each essential or specialized health service, the minimum personnel, \\nequipment and infrastructure requirements for each service were determined. Each component required \\nto offer the specific health service was given equal weight, and a cumulative availability of those \\ncomponents was determined. The tracer indicators used to assess in each area is indicated in each \\nassessment area. The service readiness was calculated as a percentage of the required service \\ncomponents that were available.  This was calculated for every service per health facility, per County and \\nNationally.  \\n \\nAnalysis of Human Resource for Health data included estimation of access (per 10,000 population) to \\nspecific cadre of health personnel.

A total of 14,883 health facilities were visited translating to 104% coverage. Sixty-\\nthree facilities in the Kenya Master Facility List lacked identification codes (KMFL code) while 2,633 were \\nmissing in the Kenya Master Facility List. A total of 203 facilities denied access to their premises. Out of \\nthose assessed, 12,384 (83%) health facility had reports uploaded to the server and were defined as \\ncomplete (having all the 3 assessed sections). A total of 736 (5%) health facility reports were incomplete \\n(missed 1 or 2 of the three assessed sections) and 1,560 (10%) of the total assessed facilities were closed \\nat the time of assessment. The national coverage of the census is summarized in table 1 below. \\nTable 1: National Summary; Facilities Targeted Over Facilities Assessed, Closed & Denied Access \\nFacility census National coverage \\nTarget Facilities \\n14,366 \\nCoverage (Total facilities assessed) \\n14,883 (104%) \\nFacilities Completed (with 3 sections \\ncomplete) \\n12,384 (83%) \\nIncomplete facilities \\n736 (5%) \\nFacilities Closed \\n1,560 (10%) \\nFacilities denied access \\n203 (1%) \\n(%) Assessment Completion \\n83% \\n \\nAmong the 47 counties, Nairobi and Nakuru had the highest number of targeted health facilities at 1,319 \\nand 645 respectively, while Isiolo and Lamu had the least, at 82 and 71 respectively.

The tracer indicators used to assess readiness for emergencies services \\ninclude, availability of an accident and emergency unit, referral mechanisms and access to an ambulance (BLS \\nor ALS). \\nOut of these 166 (2.3%), 138(5.9%) and 4(80%) were level 2, 3 and 6 respectively. For emergency services, \\n100% of all the facilities that offer Basic Outpatient services had referral mechanisms across all the levels. \\nOf the 49% of the facilities that had access to an ambulance, 31% could access a BLS Ambulance, 9% could \\naccess both BLS and ALS while only 6% had access to ALS ambulance only. \\nDiscussion and conclusion \\nSummarily, the status of emergency services in the country are at a precarious state as indicated by the \\ncensus. For instance, only 5.8% of all facilities had accident and emergency services while 49% facilities \\nhad access to an ambulance. A third of those with access to an ambulance could only access a BLS \\nAmbulance. We are however in a good place as it pertains to referral services where the service is 100% \\navailable in all facility levels. \\nRecommendation \\nThe facilities should ensure that they have arrangements to access an ambulance even on contract basis \\nto allow for faster access in times of need. Higher level facilities should be resourced to acquire an \\nambulance so as to support the lower-level facilities. \\n3.3.11 Infection prevention and control (IPC) \\nInfection prevention is paramount to both the patients and health care providers and a critical part of \\nquality and safety. The IPC practices were observed to be lowest in level 2 facilities and improved in the \\nhigher levels of care.  Availability of IPC guidelines were observed in 61%, 78%, 88%, 91%, and 100% of \\nlevel 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 facilities respectively. The fact that these guidelines lacked in 39% and 22% of level 2 \\nand 3 facilities respectively means a high risk of infections. \\nWaste segregation allows for different types of waste to be handled in the most effective and sustainable \\nmanner. Medical waste was found to be segregated into 3-color coded bins which existed in 88%, 94%, \\n98%, in level 2, 3, and 4 facilities and 100% in level 5 and 6 facilities. Safe boxes are a critical part of \\nmedical waste segregation and promote safety while handling sharps.. Availability of safety boxes at all \\nrelevant service points was observed in 94%, 97%, and 98% of level 2, 3, and 4 facilities respectively and \\n100% of level 5 and 6 facilities. \\nSecuring medical waste appropriately before disposal prevents tampering of the same by unauthorized \\npersons and promotes safety of the handlers and the community.   Availability of a secured holding area \\nfor medical waste was found in 57%, 74%, 87%, 88%, and 100% of level 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 respectively. The \\neventual waste disposal needs to conform to prescribed standards for environmental sustainability. \\nAvailability of incinerator/microwave was observed in 14%, 28%, 43%, 62%, and 60% of level 2,3,4,5 and 6 \\nrespectively.

This means that the community is having to \\ntravel far to access the health facilities or they have to wait for long to get the services due to \\novercrowding. The availability of personnel in the PHC facilities is key and a vehicle towards achieving \\nUHC. Unavailability may lead to low trust of the community      towards the facilities (Ministry of Health, \\nMay 2021). Also, it alludes to the few basic outpatient services that were being delivered at these levels. \\nInvesting in PHC is a strategy that can attain better health outcomes at reduced cost as compared to over \\nemphasis on disease specific or hospital-based care. In addition, weak linkage was observed between \\nhealth facilities and the community as observed with low linkage of facilities to CHUs and the limited \\noutreach services across the levels. Mental, dental and rehabilitation services availability was low across \\nthe different KEPH levels, while generally, the majority of the facilities did not offer all the basic outpatient \\nservices.  Both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical supplies were noted to be least available in      \\nPHC facilities, which may lead patients to seek care from higher level facilities.  \\n67%\\n83%\\n51%\\n58%\\n89%\\n85%\\n96%\\n85%\\n81%\\n78%\\n83%\\n44%\\n25%\\n24%\\n94%\\n33%\\n26%\\n67%\\n70%\\n65%\\n92%\\n94%\\n91%\\n4%\\n84%\\n87%\\n80%\\n84%\\n93%\\n89%\\n97%\\n93%\\n93%\\n91%\\n95%\\n66%\\n58%\\n58%\\n96%\\n57%\\n58%\\n80%\\n81%\\n81%\\n93%\\n94%\\n94%\\n18%\\n94%\\n94%\\n93%\\n94%\\n96%\\n95%\\n97%\\n97%\\n96%\\n95%\\n97%\\n85%\\n91%\\n89%\\n96%\\n82%\\n86%\\n90%\\n93%\\n90%\\n97%\\n96%\\n95%\\n54%\\nAutoclaving Tape, 3/4’’\\nBandage, Cotton, L/Woven…\\nCatheter, Foley\\'s, 18FG…\\nCord Clamp\\nCotton Gauze Plain,…\\nCotton Wool, Absorbent,…\\nGloves, Latex, Examination,…\\nGloves, Surgical,…\\nIV cannula 18G\\n IV cannula 20G\\nIV infusion Giving Set…\\nMaternity Pad, 26cm x…\\nNasal Prongs for…\\nNasal Prongs for…\\nSafety Boxes (WHO…\\nSolusets for Fluids\\nSuction Catheter with…\\nSurgical Blade with Handle, Size 23\\nSuture Nylon No.2/0,3/8…\\nSuture Polyglactin 2/0 75cm…\\nSyringe 2mL + needle 23G x 1\"\\nSyringe 5mL + needle 21G x 1.5\"\\n127w.

The human resource should be revamped in the PHC as it presents a threat in the delivery of \\nUniversal Health Coverage. Relevant personnel should be available including at least a clinical \\nofficer/medical officer and a dental staff in each of the facilities. \\n2. The equipment and supplies that are key in delivery of the basic outpatient package should be \\nprovided in the PHC.  \\n3. To enhance quality UHC and availability of healthcare at PHC levels, it is essential that       basic \\nradiology equipment such as X-rays and ultrasound  are placed at the PHC levels          . \\n4. Since the country is gearing towards reducing maternal mortality and morbidity, it is essential that \\ninvestments are done at PHC facilities to have the requisite personnel, commodities, equipment \\nand appropriate referral mechanism to provide quality maternal and newborn services during and \\nafter pregnancy. \\n5. CHU linkage to the health facilities should be enhanced to at least 90% in the PHC facilities; as well \\nas leverage on the private sector to support CHUs.  \\nLIMITATIONS \\n1. Training for the large number of data collectors was done within a limited time virtually. This may \\nhave impacted the capacity of the data collectors to collect high quality data.  \\n2. There are no existing norms on the various services assessed. This necessitated development of \\nthe service package during the report development of this census based on the facility checklists, \\nHuman resource norms and standards, the KEPH among other documents. \\n3. The levels of care used in this report was mis-matched for many facilities. Despite extensive \\ncleaning of the data, there are still some facilities that may have had an incorrect level of care. \\n4. Data on human resource assessed access rather than actual number of health workers due to staff \\nworking (and consequently being reported) in several health facilities. Data on actual numbers \\nwould be useful to determine actual numbers and calculate actual density of health workers per \\npopulation. \\nOVERALL CONCLUSIONS \\nFor UHC to be achieved, access to efficient, quality services are critical especially in Primary care facilities  \\n• \\nOnce Kenyans have an insurance coverage and are empanelled to a primary care network (PCN), \\nthere’s need to ensure that the care they access in health facilities is of the highest quality \\npossible at each level \\n• \\nReadiness of health facilities to provide health care services was is mainly threatened by \\ninadequate equipment and human resource \\n• \\nAccess to specialized services needs to be strengthened for effective PHC and specialized services \\n• \\nScale up of empanelled by NHIF is critical at all levels  \\n• \\nQuality of services need to be established to address the disconnect between high coverage and \\npoor performing Impact indicators (Maternal mortality, neonatal mortality)-Availability, work \\nconditions and competencies of health workers, quality of clinical records, patient perceptions \\namong others \\n',\n",
